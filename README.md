# Delete Key for Gmail™
This extension adds a keyboard shortcut for deleting a single email in Gmail. It performs the same action as clicking the menu button on a message and selecting 'Delete this message.' This extension is especially helpful for deleting single emails in a thread, since Gmail offers no keyboard shortcut for that action.

The default shortcut is `SHIFT + 5`, but it can be changed from the options page.
